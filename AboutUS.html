								<p>Hello, my name is Yuri Flores. I am 43 years old. I come from very humble origins. Where I come from is a place of many shortcomings. And if we add to that the fact that I grew up without parents since I was 7 years old, I assure you that these are the perfect ingredients to fill you with inspiration, goals, and dreams. For a dreamer like me, that was the perfect inspiration. The day I decided to leave my homeland for this beautiful country, the USA, I did so with the dream of being able to achieve my goals. </p>
								<p>When I arrived in the USA, I felt overwhelmed by seeing such a large and beautiful country. I started working cleaning floors and, little by little, I learned English, a beautiful language recognized worldwide. Little by little, I made my way along a narrow but sure path, with the clear objective of achieving something in my life. </p>I found the key moment to develop my potential thanks to an old friend who motivated me to work with him, although he and I could not continue together on the same project. I must admit that he was a key piece in getting my own business going. Now I thank God for all his love and mercy because thanks to him, today I am what I once dreamed of. Although on many occasions I go and do the work myself, the satisfaction of what God and this country have granted me is priceless. THANK YOU, USA. Thank you for being what you are because, like me, you have helped millions of others fulfill their dreams. Now I understand why the USA is such a great and beautiful country because it does not discriminate when it comes to lending a hand. I love and respect this country. As a well-received and cared-for tenant, the least I can be is respectful of this beautiful country and the wonderful people originally from these lands. Thank you, USA, and especially to the city of Houston, TX and its surrounding areas. GOD BLESS THE USA AND ITS BEAUTIFULÂ PEOPL</p>
